      <h2>My dearest Moonshine</h2>
      <p>
        As I sit down to write this letter to you, my heart is overflowing with
        emotions that I cannot put into words. You are the light that brightens
        up my life, the melody that makes my heart sing, and the rainbow that
        adds colors to my world. <br /><br />
        From the moment I met you, I knew that you were someone special. Your
        radiance and warmth drew me in, and I couldn't resist the pull of your
        charm. Your beauty, both inside and out, has captivated my heart, and I
        find myself thinking of you every waking moment. <br />
        <br />
        I remember the first time we walked under the moonlight in Nakuru, as
        late and dark in the night as it was, with the soft glow of the stars
        casting a romantic spell on us. I knew then that I wanted to spend the
        rest of my life with you, making memories that would last a lifetime.
        Your presence fills me with a sense of calm and contentment that I have
        never experienced before, and I am grateful for every moment I get to
        spend with you. <br />
        <br />
        Moonshine, you are my soulmate, my confidant, and my best friend. I
        cannot imagine a life without you, and I promise to love and cherish you
        for all eternity. You bring joy and meaning to my life, and I vow to
        stand by you through thick and thin, come what may. <br />
        <br />
        I want to spend every moment of my life making you happy, showing you
        how much you mean to me, and making our dreams come true. Together, we
        will conquer the world, and I know that with you by my side, anything is
        possible. <br />
        <br />
        My dearest Moonshine, I love you more than words could ever express, and
        I will always cherish and adore you. You are the love of my life, and I
        am honored to be your lover. <br />
        <br />
        Forever yours, <br />
        <br />
        Alan❤️
